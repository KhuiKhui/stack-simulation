## Stack Simulation

ðŸ¥‘ Finding stacks too hard to understand? Don't know how to visualize them? Then you've come to the right place!

ðŸ¥‘ Stack Simulation is, well, a simulation of how stacks work, more specifically, how monotonic stacks work. The site offers clear representation of array-to-stack conversion, with various stack actions for you to play with.

ðŸ¥‘ Just a little website to get me accustomed to NextJS and TypeScript
